# React Three Fiber Starter App

This is a starter template for building 3D applications using React Three Fiber. The main focus is to use this template in CodeSandbox online.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template in CodeSandbox, follow these steps:

1. Open a new terminal window in CodeSandbox.
2. Change directory to the `r3f-starter-app` using the command:
    ```bash

    ```
4. Run the development server using the command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Now you should be able to see your React Three Fiber application running and you can start developing your 3D app!

## Features

- Pre-configured React Three Fiber setup
